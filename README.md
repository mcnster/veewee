# About this 'mcnster' fork of Veewee

(Find the project's original REAMDE.md at [README-ORIG.md](README-ORIG.md).)

The purpose of this fork is to bring some or all of the Veewee [templates](templates) up to date with the state of current (2017) distribution releases and to track new templates that I find useful.


## Code changes

* Replaced ':paranoid' with ':verify_host_key' to suppress annoying deprecation messages.


## General notes

* Seems to work properly with ruby-2.4.2.
